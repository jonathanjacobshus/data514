### Document Store Design for Flightapp

#### Overview
In a document store like AsterixDB, data is stored as JSON-like documents, which allow for nested structures and complex data types. This design supports a flexible and hierarchical data model suitable for Flightapp.

#### Aggregate Types (Classes)

1. **Flight Document**
    - **Key**: `flight_id`
    - **Structure**:
      - flight_id: unique identifier for the flight
      - carrier: nested object containing:
        - carrier_id: unique identifier for the carrier
        - carrier_name: name of the carrier
      - origin: origin city of the flight
      - destination: destination city of the flight
      - departure_time: departure time of the flight
      - arrival_time: arrival time of the flight
      - capacity: total capacity of the flight
      - reservable_capacity: remaining capacity available for reservations

2. **User Document**
    - **Key**: `user_id`
    - **Structure**:
      - user_id: unique identifier for the user
      - username: username of the user
      - password: hashed password of the user
      - balance: account balance of the user
      - reservations: array of nested objects, each containing:
        - reservation_id: unique identifier for the reservation
        - is_paid: boolean indicating if the reservation is paid
        - reservation_date: date of the reservation
        - flights: array of nested objects, each containing:
          - flight_id: unique identifier for the flight
          - origin: origin city of the flight
          - destination: destination city of the flight
          - departure_time: departure time of the flight
          - arrival_time: arrival time of the flight

3. **Itinerary Document**
    - **Key**: `itinerary_id`
    - **Structure**:
      - itinerary_id: unique identifier for the itinerary
      - origin: origin city of the itinerary
      - destination: destination city of the itinerary
      - is_direct: boolean indicating if the itinerary is direct
      - flights: array of nested objects, each containing:
        - flight_id: unique identifier for the flight
        - departure_time: departure time of the flight
        - arrival_time: arrival time of the flight

#### Implementation Notes
- **Reservable Capacity Management**: When a reservation is made, the corresponding flight documents are updated to decrement the `reservable_capacity`.
- **User Reservations**: User documents embed reservations, which include detailed flight information to minimize the need for additional queries.
- **Indexing**: Utilize indexes on common query fields such as `origin`, `destination`, and `username` to optimize search and access patterns.

This document-oriented approach leverages the flexibility of document stores to manage hierarchical data structures and efficiently handle the diverse query patterns required by Flightapp.



1. There exists a flight 1234 from Seattle, WA to Los Angeles, CA with exactly 5 unreserved seats
2. Hannah searches for a Seattle->LA itinerary and sees flight 1234
3. She attempts to reserve a seat on flight 1234, but accidentally clicks the button twice

What is your document store's final state?


Choice 1 of 4: the user has two reservations, and the flight's unreserved capacity is consistent with this

Choice 2 of 4: the user has one reservation, and the flight's unreserved capacity is consistent with this

Choice 3 of 4: the user has zero reservations, and the flight's unreserved capacity is consistent with this

Choice 4 of 4: the flight's unreserved capacity is inconsistent with the user's reservations
