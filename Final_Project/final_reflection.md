# DATA 514 Final Project Reflection


### 1. What was the subject matter of your project?
	BDD100K Data Management - Efficient Schema Design and Query Optimization

## Data Management Section

### 2. What was the most challenging part of your database design?
	The most challenging part of our database design was accurately representing the complex relationships and diverse data types within the BDD100K dataset. Balancing normalization with query performance, especially for nested and hierarchical data, required careful consideration. Additionally, optimizing the schema for multiple use cases and future extensibility, while ensuring data integrity and compliance with privacy regulations, was particularly difficult. Ensuring high performance across various queries with such a large dataset also posed significant challenges.

### 3. What did you find to be the most helpful in thinking about your database design?
	The most helpful aspect in thinking about our database design was thoroughly understanding the dataset and its use cases. Analyzing the specific tasks and queries the database needed to support guided our schema design and ensured it was both practical and efficient. Additionally, leveraging best practices in database normalization and indexing helped us create a robust structure that balanced data integrity and performance. Consulting documentation and resources on PostgreSQL's capabilities also provided valuable insights for optimizing our design.

### 4. What is something that will you keep in mind next time you are involved with a database design?
	Next time I'm involved in database design, I will prioritize understanding the specific use cases and performance requirements from the outset. Thoroughly analyzing how the data will be queried and accessed will guide the design process. Additionally, I'll emphasize iterative testing and optimization to ensure the schema is adaptable to future changes. Focusing on data governance and compliance from the beginning will be crucial for long-term sustainability and security.


### 5. What is something you are still wondering about database design?
	Next time I'm involved in database design, I will prioritize understanding the specific use cases and performance requirements from the outset. This includes thoroughly analyzing how the data will be queried and accessed. Additionally, I'll place greater emphasis on iterative testing and optimization, ensuring that the schema not only meets initial requirements but is also flexible enough to adapt to future changes. Emphasizing data governance and compliance from the beginning will also be crucial to ensure long-term sustainability and security.


## Presentation

### 6. What is one thing you learned about communication about data management?
	I learned that clear and concise communication is essential for effective data management. It is crucial to convey complex technical details in a way that is understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. This ensures everyone involved can make informed decisions and collaborate effectively.

### 7. What is one thing you felt you did well in the presentation?
	While I will not be able to present due to personal issues, I feel that I effectively supported my teammate by providing the necessary write-ups and information to ensure the presentation will go well.


### 8. What is one thing you might try to improve for your next presentation?
	I believe that being well-prepared for presentations is crucial. Although I might not always be as prepared as I should be, I recognize this as an important lesson. For my next presentation, I will strive to ensure thorough preparation to enhance my confidence and effectiveness.

### 9. What is one thing your teammate(s) did well in the presentation?
	My teammate did an excellent job preparing for the presentation. He ensured that all key points were clearly covered. His preparation and attention to detail greatly contributed to the success of our presentation.


## Team Work

### 10. What was the most challenging aspect of working on a team for this project?
The most challenging aspect of working on a team for this project was coordinating schedules and ensuring consistent communication. Balancing different availability and ensuring that everyone was on the same page required effective time management and regular updates.

### 11. What is one thing you did that contributed to team success in this project?
	Given my inability to be there and present in person, I focused on taking on a significant portion of the write-up work. This effort was aimed at easing my partner's workload, allowing him to concentrate on creating the slides and refining his original proposal to match his vision. By managing the documentation, I ensured that our project was well-documented and cohesive, supporting our overall success.

### 12. What is one thing your partner(s) did that contributed to the success of your team in this project?
	My partner's flexibility and openness to suggestions greatly contributed to our team's success. His willingness to consider new ideas and adapt our approach as needed ensured that we effectively incorporated both of our strengths and perspectives into the project. This collaborative spirit helped us refine our work and achieve our shared goals.
